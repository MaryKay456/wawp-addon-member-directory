# WAP Member Directory Addon
This plugin contains a member directory block (`member-directory`) and a member profile block (`member-profile`). The code for each block resides in respective folders in `blocks/`.

# Installation
To install this add on you must have installed [Wild Apricot Press](https://github.com/NewPath-Consulting/Wild-Apricot-For-Wordpress/blob/master/README.md) ahead of time. You also will need to use a license key to add this add on. License keys can be obtained on the [NewPath website](https://newpathconsulting.com/wawp).

The addon zip archive can be installed like any plugin using Plugins -> Add New. Once installed, you should go to the [WAP License Key screen](https://github.com/NewPath-Consulting/Wild-Apricot-For-Wordpress/blob/master/README.md#licensing-wawp) to add your license key. Free addons like Member Directory use the same license key as WAP.
